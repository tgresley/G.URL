# G.URL
G.URL is a web-based, interactive identity narrative work aimed at satirizing and crtitiquing the internet content directed toward young girls. G.URL adopts the aesthetics of #girlboss internet feminism, and oversaturates them with familiar imagery of pixelated gif’s, hello kitty and memes to make visible, and interactive, the conditioning of neo-liberal, choice feminism into the cultural zeitgeist of pre-teen and teen girls. Through creating an interactive identity that unfolds through the exploration of the website and its hyperlinked narrative, quizzes, personalization and poetics, G.URL aims to make the user self-aware of the ridiculousness of internet aesthetics #lanacore #lolitacore and how they have shaped their own conception of femininity – a collection of neatly organised aesthetic identities #cleangirl #girlrot #girlblog. The work uses HTML, CSS, p5*js and API, grounding itself firmly in the girl-internet it is critiquing. G.URL is inspired by internet artists Molly Soda and Martine Neddam’s ‘mouchette.org’ who uniquely recreate internet girl aesthetics and the construction of identity online according to their contexts; 90’s and 2010’s internet, respectively. My work aims to extend upon each these cyberfeminism’s, existing within the internet culture of 2025 #girlmath.
